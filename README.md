# An experiment of testing Express.js with jest

This is an experimental project for me to learn how test Express.js project efficiently.

## Base requirements

- This project provides simple APIs.
- Some APIs use a database like SQL Database or something.
- This project is created by [express-generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator).

## Test requirements

- Compose with small components to test easily as unit test
- E2E test with supertest
- Mocking database in test
